# Register any asset with your ownership with Assetic (Dummy Application as of now)

Assetic allows you to register any physical asset on the Ethereum blockchain by providing an identification of the asset together with a description. A digital token which will represent the asset can now be tracked and transfered between any two persons all over the world.

## Goal

Practice writing smart contracts and adding functionality, working on them through truffle and test them in its testing environment, building out a ui to interact with the smart contracts, and deploying the app on heroku and the contracts on the Rinkeby Network.

The app is live (non-functional as of now):
